					<h3>Mira Jones</h3>
					<h4>Founder, Consultant</h4>
					<p><a href="http://iaabc.com/" title="">Mira Jones is an </a><a href="http://iaabc.com/" title="">IAABC Certified Dog Behavior Consultant</a> and a professional member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT). In 2011, she was one of the first trainers in the East to complete the NACSW Certified Nose Work Instructor course, and for the past 9 years she has completed all requirements set forth by the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers. Mira is a Nosework Certifying Official and Judge for the <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com/" title="">United Kennel Club (UKC)</a>.</p>
					<p>Mira has more than 20 years&#8217; experience working with dogs and dog owners. She has trained hundreds of dogs of all breeds and temperaments, has taught group classes, written training curriculum, lectured on animal behavior, has completed graduate-level courses in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Behavior_Analysis" title="">Applied Behavior Analysis</a>.</p>
					<p> Mira&#8217;s interest in scent detection was the natural outgrowth of her fascination with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_ecology" title="">behavioral ecology</a>, the study of how animals behave in their evolutionary niche. For Mira, helping companion dogs through scent work is the perfect bridge between training and behavior, between dog and owner, and between urban realities and canine enrichment.</p>
