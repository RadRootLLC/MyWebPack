		  <h3 class="card-header">The Right Start Puppy Program</h3>
		  <div class="card-body">
				<p>In this innovative premium program, Tail Lights Dogs trains and socializes your puppy for you during a 6 week program scheduled for your convenience.</p>
				<p>Puppy attends Day School 3 days per week for the first 3 weeks, then 2 days per week for the second 3 weeks of the program. During this time, you may attend as many puppy group classes as you can fit into your busy schedule.  The program includes three bathing experiences, by our gentle, positive trainers to help your puppy learn to like baths, nail trims, and handling.</p>
				<p>At the conclusion of the first week, you will have a private lesson with a Tail Lights trainer to help you get started with the appropriate training equipment and good on-leash behavior. At the end of the 6 week program, another private lesson helps you integrate your puppy's new skills into real-life situations, and gets you ready for the next step. A relaxation mat and harness are included in the program.</p>
